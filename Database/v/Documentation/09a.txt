09a:	This error is flagged there was a variable in a level sensitive always block
	wasn't used in a calculation, making the signal unneeded in the sensitivity 
	list.

Example:
module IncompleteSensList("inputs and outputs");
	reg c;
	always @(a or b)begin //b flagged as unused
		c = a;
	end	
endmodule

To fix remove unused variables from sensitivity list or include it in an
assignment statement.
