06:	This error is generated if the same signal is being assigned
	in multiple always blocks and/or assign statements.
	The error lists what line they are on.
	The List will also contain ports of vectors that are falling under
	this rule.

Example:
module MultiplyDrivenSignals(
  input wire one,
  output reg two,
  output wire three
  );
  
	wire four;
  
	reg five;

  
  
	always@(one)begin
    
		two = 0;<font color=#ff0000>//error report assigned in second always</font>  
	end
  
  
	always@(two)begin
    
		five = 0;
    
		two = 1;//error report assigned in first always
  
	end

  
  
	assign three = 0;//error report assigned in assign statement below
  
	assign three = 1;
//error report assigned in error statement above  
	assign four = 0;
  

endmodule

To Fix make sure there is only one assign statement per variable and that the
variable is not being set in multiple always blocks
