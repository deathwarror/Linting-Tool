06:	This error is flagged if the sensitivity list of an always block only has 
	one item and if the list type is edge sensitive.
	The item this is searching for is a reset variable included in the sensitivity
	list for a flip flop always block.

Example:
module ClkErrors("inputs and outputs");

	always @(posedge clk)begin//edge sensitive and one item in 
							sensitivity list
		//lines
	end	
endmodule

To fix make sure there is atleast one unused signal and one used signal in an 
edge sensitive always block.
