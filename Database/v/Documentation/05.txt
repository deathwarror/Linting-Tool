05:	This error is flagged if the clock identified in one always block does not
	match the clock identified in another always block.

Example:
module ClkErrors("inputs and outputs");

	always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)begin//clk is identified as clock
		//lines
	end
	always @(posedge clk2 or posedge reset)begin//clk2 is identified as clock
						    //clk from first always and 
						            clk2 don't match
		//lines
	end	
endmodule

To fix make sure the clock variables match in all always blocks.
