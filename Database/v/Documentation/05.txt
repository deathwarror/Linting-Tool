05:	This error is flagged if the assignment operators in an always block do not
	match the type of always block.

Example:
module AssignmentVsSensType(input wire clk, input wire reset,
			     input wire a, input wire b,
			     output reg c, output d);
	
	always @(a)begin//level sensitive
		c <= a;//Line will be flagged because the usage of <= in a 
				level sensitive block
	end
	always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)begin//edge sensitive
		if (reset)begin
			d <= 0;
		end
		else
			d = b;//Line will be flagged because a blocking statement is
				being used in a edge sensitive block
		end
	end	
endmodule

To fix make all edge sensitive blocks contain non blocking statments and all level
sensitive blocks contain blocking statments.
