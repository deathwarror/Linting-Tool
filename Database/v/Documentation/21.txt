Error 21:
Code has been detected where the name of the function or task is either unknown or a module instantiation is missing its defining name

Example:
module MissingModuleNameOrTask_FunctionDeclaration(
  input wire in,
  input wire b,
  input wire a,
  output reg sum,
  output reg c_out,
  output reg out);
 
   //These are OK because they are known as modelsim default functions
   and(c_out,a,b);
   xor(sum,a,b);
 
   //These will produce Errors!
   Custom2(out,in); //This is not a known function or task because it is a
                      custom task or function.
 
endmodule
 



Probable Solution:
To fix this error give the module a name. Tasks or Functions in Separate files are currently not supported by the parser
