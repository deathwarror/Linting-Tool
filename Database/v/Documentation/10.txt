10:	This error is flagged for a vector series being preset in the sensitivity list
	of an always block.

Example:
module VectorArrayInSensList("inputs and outputs");
	reg [2:0] a;
	reg c;
	always @(a)begin //a flagged vector in sensitivity list
		//lines
	end	
endmodule

To fix remove the vector or list each port with its sensitivity.
