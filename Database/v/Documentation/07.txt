07:	The Signal used for the clock could be explicitly used in a if statement.
	This is usually flagged for an always block that has no unused signals in the
	sensitivity list.
module ClkErrors("inputs and outputs")
	Always @("Sensitivity List")begin
		if("One of the Sensitivity List Items")begin
			//lines
		end
		//more else if statements
		else if("Last Sensitivity List item causing all to be used") begin
			//lines
		end
	end

To Correct the Issue, make sure one item from the sensitivity list is not used.
