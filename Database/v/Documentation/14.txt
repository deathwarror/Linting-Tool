14:	This error is reported if the an input port is being assigned a value or
	if an output port is being used in the right hand side of an assignment statement


Example:
module BackwardPortDirection(input wire a, input wire b,
			     output wire c, output reg d);
	
	assign c = b&&d;//will flag output used in calculation
	assign b = a;//will flag input is being assigned
	always @(b)begin
		a = d;//will flag both output used in calculation and input being 
				assigned
	end
endmodule

To fix verify that variables are being used on the correct side of the = or <= sign
