15:	This Error is reported if an always block contains blocking and non blocking
	assignment statements.
	This error list the first two that match the error.

Example:
module BlockingNonBLocking(input wire clk, input wire reset,
			   input wire data1, input wire data2,
			   input wire select, output reg c);
	always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)begin
		if(reset)begin	
			out <=1'b0;//error flagged with non blocking line
		end
		else begin
			if(select == 1'b0)begin
				out <= data1;
			end
			else begin
				out = data2;//error flagged with blocking line
			end
		end
	end
endmodule

To fix this issue make sure all assignment statements in always block match.
	
Please note that using incorrect assignment statements for the type of 
	always block will also trigger an error.
	Follow the pattern where if an always block sensitivity list has edges
	then all assignment statements need <= and for level sensitive lists need
	=  in them.
