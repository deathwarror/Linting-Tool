11:	This error is flagged for a vector series with a logical not (!) symbol preceding 
	the vector name.  This will not flag if the vector is inside parathesis.
	!(vector) will not trigger the error because it assumes some sort of calculation.
	
	Error is flagged because logical not caused a single bit to be return, and on
	vectors it returns least significant bit with the not operand.

Example:
module LogicalNotWithVector("inputs and outputs");
	wire [4:0] vect;
	reg [4:0] out;
	assign out = !vect; //flags vector usage with the logical not
endmodule

To fix remove switch the character (!) with (~) the bit wise not character
