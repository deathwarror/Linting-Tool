09b:	This error is flagged there was a variable in a level sensitive always block
	was used in a calculation but wasn't listed in the sensitivity list.

Example:
module IncompleteSensList("inputs and outputs");
	reg c;
	always @(a)begin //b flagged as un listed
		c = a*b;
	end	
endmodule

To fix remove unused variables from sensitivity list or include it in an
assignment statement.
